# convert-to-latex

Here I will try to implement conversion of screenshots of high quality text and math eqations to LaTeX code. Since the characters should be easily recognizable, I will try some segmentation and template mathing algorithms instead of things like deep neural networks and similar. The hard part are equations, I look forward to figuring out how to do that.
